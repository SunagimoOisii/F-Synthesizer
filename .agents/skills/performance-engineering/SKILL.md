## F-Synthesizer application profile

Read the repository-root `AGENTS.md` and relevant implementation first. User
instructions and that file define scope and product constraints; this profile
adapts how the upstream workflow and references below apply here. Retain baseline,
mechanism diagnosis, numerical correctness, representative measurement, and the
keep/revert decision. Scope down irrelevant diagnostics, not evidence quality.

- Identify the affected operation: MIDI opening, first audible playback, live
  tone changes, steady playback, or WAV export. Measure the stage in question and
  the complete user operation where it can be observed. CPU time, wall time, queue
  delay, and device latency are different; do not label a generation timestamp as
  when sound reached the listener. Profiling without execution yields hypotheses.
- Use this Windows PC, MSVC and a Release build for speed comparisons. Read the
  existing script parameters (`check.ps1 -Configuration Release` builds without
  opening the IDE). Keep input MIDI, preset revisions, sample rate, polyphony,
  effects, and build settings comparable. Reuse existing checks from `AGENTS.md`.
  Debug tests check correctness, not Release performance. Prefer an available
  Windows profiler or bounded timing of the relevant operation; Linux perf,
  WSL, CMake, Rust, and new dependencies are not prerequisites for this task.
- Preserve the normal ProjectModel-to-SynthEngine path and audio/device ownership
  obligations in `AGENTS.md`. Retain checks for audible quality, MIDI timing,
  preview/loop response, underruns, peak/retained memory, and worst/tail processing
  time where affected. A faster average does not excuse new dropouts. The current
  64-sample update granularity and roughly 20-ms ring are context, not universal
  end-to-end latency guarantees or freely expendable buffering headroom.
- Compare deterministic output against a fixed baseline. For floating-point or
  stochastic changes, define justified tolerances or control randomness and
  examine the relevant signal behavior. Finite PCM and a passing build alone do
  not establish that sound is unchanged. Keep measurements and listening claims
  separate. Do not weaken signal quality solely for a speed result.
- Follow the upstream order of removing work before specialization when evidence
  supports it. SIMD, caching, pooling, or new abstractions remain valid choices
  when measured benefit justifies their maintenance cost; simple code is not a
  reason to reject a useful improvement. Keep experiments separable and reversible.
- Use short representative paired trials and targeted regression checks, expanding
  only for unresolved evidence or affected cases. The upstream 0.95 gate is a
  suggested no-regression policy, not an automatic allowance for audible or
  interactive regressions, and passing it does not prove improvement. State any
  chosen thresholds and uncertainty; inconclusive evidence stays inconclusive.
- Report the upstream template's substance concisely in the conversation. Keep
  raw inputs and results under ignored `F-Synthesizer/output/` when needed; a new
  permanent report, service load plan, CI system, or benchmark framework is not
  required for every change. Consult only relevant references. Bundled scripts
  and examples are optional: inspect before running, use isolated output paths,
  and do not overwrite the upstream historical validation record. Those records
  describe the author's tested environments, not validation of this app or MSVC.

## Upstream workflow (preserved)


# Performance engineering

Make the required work cheaper, then make the remaining work run efficiently.
An optimization is a hypothesis until it passes correctness and representative
measurement. Do not confuse a lower instruction count, fewer allocations, or
wider vectors with a faster application.

## Scope and source policy

Use this skill for libraries, services, parsers, compression, search, numerical
kernels, and data-processing pipelines, including the operating-system and
request-path constraints that determine their performance. It is not a complete
GPU, distributed-systems, database, or cryptographic implementation manual.

The low-level foundation is Algorithmica's *Algorithms for Modern Hardware*.
Systems diagnosis draws on Brendan Gregg's *Systems Performance: Enterprise and
the Cloud*, second edition, and his public methodology guides. Prevention and
lifecycle guidance draw on Den Odell's public *Fast by Default* model and the
publisher's early-access book material. Full book texts were not accessed for
this update. See [the source index](references/sources.md) for access boundaries,
check dates, and supporting primary documentation. Do not invent unavailable
chapter content or formal framework details. Historical case-study speedups are
not promises for another compiler, processor, or deployment.

Follow the repository's language, safety, API, and compatibility rules. Do not
rewrite the project in Rust or C++ merely because examples use them. Verify
version-sensitive library APIs and ISA requirements before implementing them.

## Start here

Inspect the code, tests, build configuration, dependency lockfile, benchmarks,
existing profiles, and target platforms. Establish the following contract from
available information; explicitly label anything still assumed:

- **Work:** input sizes, distributions, frequency, throughput versus latency,
  concurrency, arrival model, startup versus steady state, and output quality.
  Name the user/caller operation and its usable-completion boundary.
- **Correctness:** exactness, overflow, ordering and ties, floating-point error,
  invalid inputs, determinism, and security-sensitive behavior.
- **Resources:** CPU targets, memory budget, retained memory, allocation budget,
  supported compilers, effective CPU/container limits, queue/in-flight bounds,
  and allowed implementation complexity.
- **Budgets and ownership:** absolute latency/goodput/resource targets, required
  cohorts and load, relative regression policy, evidence needed for a decision,
  and the owner of the benchmark and rollout/rollback decision.

For new software, create a [performance budget](templates/performance-budget.md),
a simple correct baseline, and representative workloads. For existing software,
reproduce the complaint before changing it.
For a review without execution access, provide ranked hypotheses and a runnable
measurement plan; never invent a profile or a measured speedup.

## Required workflow

### 0. Select the scope and prevention/investigation path

For an application complaint, move from useful-operation latency to the critical
path, thread states, limiting resources, and finally code. Use workload
characterization and USE/TSA when the limiting stage is unknown. Do not jump to
SIMD because the repository contains a hot loop. A kernel-only task may begin
with its measured CPU/memory mechanism, but must retain an end-to-end check.

For a new feature, map calls, bytes, handoffs, state lifetime, and concurrency
before implementation. Define budgets, a baseline/oracle, and verification
ownership. Read only the reference needed for the current stage; do not load the
entire bundle or require every diagnostic for a small local change.

### 1. Establish a trustworthy baseline

Build with production-like optimization and target features. Separate setup,
allocation, initialization, kernel execution, and cleanup measurements where
useful, but retain an end-to-end benchmark containing the costs users pay.
Record environment, commands, input identity, and raw samples. Preserve a scalar
or otherwise simple correctness oracle.

### 2. Identify a limiting mechanism

Use a CPU profile, allocation profile, wall-clock breakdown, and suitable hardware
counters. Classify the main limitation: unnecessary work, bandwidth, dependent
memory latency, branch recovery, arithmetic throughput, arithmetic dependency
latency, allocation/initialization, synchronization, I/O, or front-end/code size.
A hot function is a location, not a diagnosis. Counter values are clues, not proof.
For a service, also test admission/executor queueing, runnable delay, quota
throttling, downstream waits, and overload. CPU-profile percentages are not
percentages of request wall time. Separate useful work, intentional idle, and
critical-path waiting; never add overlapping spans or all threads' waits.

Keep an evidence ledger: observation with scope/denominator, competing hypothesis,
expected effect, discriminating experiment, and disconfirming result. Unknown
metrics remain unknown. Actively observe the benchmark and generator to verify
that the intended valid work, not a shortcut or failure path, is being measured.

Estimate potential benefit. For a fraction `p` of baseline execution accelerated
by `s`, the idealized overall speedup is `1 / ((1-p) + p/s)`. State assumptions;
interactions with caching, parallelism, and input distribution can change them.

### 3. Choose the least costly effective transformation

Normally try this order, changing it only when evidence warrants:

1. Remove repeated work, unnecessary passes, copying, and unsuitable algorithms.
2. Improve representation, locality, object size, and ownership boundaries.
3. Bound allocations and reuse; reduce justified initialization work.
4. Expose invariants, simplify hot loops, and enable compiler optimization.
5. Improve dependency structure, batching, and instruction-level parallelism.
6. Add explicit SIMD where it improves the identified mechanism.
7. Add or tune parallelism without exceeding memory and bandwidth budgets.

Write down the expected effect and failure mode before implementing. Keep
independent experiments separable. Do not pile on speculative changes.

### 4. Preserve the semantic contract

For integers, distinguish wrapping, checked, saturating, and mathematical
arithmetic. For floating point, specify precision, rounding/reassociation,
NaN/infinity/subnormal behavior, and application-level error. For searches and
argmin, preserve first/last match and tie policy. For compression, test output
validity and size/quality, not just encoding time.

Use a scalar tail or a demonstrably safe masked operation. Never read beyond an
allocation and then discard the result. Never read uninitialized memory. An
aligned address, a valid index, and a supported instruction set are separate
proof obligations. Unsafe code requires local safety comments and adversarial
tests; it is not a default performance technique.

### 5. Inspect the result, not the source's appearance

Inspect optimized assembly or optimization remarks for the actual hot path:
vectorization, scalarized gathers, bounds checks, divisions, calls, spills,
reductions, redundant initialization, and feature-dispatch placement. A vector
API can lower to scalar instructions. A clean scalar loop can already vectorize.

### 6. Validate and decide

Differentially test empty/tiny inputs, vector boundaries, misaligned starts,
duplicates, sparse and skewed data, maximal values, and error cases. Exercise
fallbacks directly. Run sanitizers or language-appropriate memory/concurrency
checks separately from performance measurements.

Benchmark representative size and distribution buckets with paired,
interleaved baseline/candidate trials. Re-profile the full application. Measure
peak and post-burst retained memory as well as runtime. Keep an optimization only
when its application benefit justifies its maintenance and portability costs.

For queued/shared systems, validate the arrival model and use a
[load-test plan](templates/load-test-plan.md) covering applicable peak, burst,
soak, degraded-dependency, and recovery behavior. Keep errors, dropped arrivals,
retries, and generator lag visible. Do not average per-instance quantiles or
infer request p99 from batch means. Use dedicated tail/resource analyses; the
bundled paired-scalar comparator does not certify those budgets.

### 7. Prevent the next regression

Keep the accepted case, workload identity, absolute budget, and reviewed release
baseline. Put reliable cheap checks near development and heavier load/target
checks on an appropriate controlled stage. Mark pending, missing, and inconclusive
evidence explicitly. Define observation and rollback criteria, assign an owner,
and revisit obsolete dependencies, data growth, cache policy, and specializations.
Do not automatically rebaseline away a regression.

## Acceptance rules

Correctness is mandatory. Respect user-defined budgets and gates. Otherwise,
propose the following configurable starting gate rather than silently changing
the project's policy:

- Each required workload/target case must demonstrate normalized speedup
  `>= 0.95`, with an uncertainty-aware result; inconclusive is not a pass.
- A claimed improvement must also show a meaningful gain in its target objective.
  Merely passing the no-regression gate is not evidence of improvement.
- Memory, output quality, tail latency, and compatibility have separate gates.
  A geometric mean must not conceal a required case's regression.
- Absolute user-facing and resource budgets must also pass at the specified load.
  Repeated small regressions can violate them despite passing individual relative
  gates. Useful goodput must exclude invalid output and account for failures.

Normalize as `baseline_time / candidate_time` for time and
`candidate_rate / baseline_rate` for throughput. Note that a `0.95` time-speedup
floor allows a time increase of about `5.263%`; use `1/1.05` for a strict `5%`
time-increase allowance. The included paired-bootstrap utility implements the
first definition, not a universal statistical policy.

## Safe observation and experiments

Scope diagnostics to authorized processes and environments. Bound profiling and
load overhead, protect captured data, and state visibility gaps. Do not change
host-wide tunables, flush global caches, relax security, weaken durability, or
increase production traffic merely to obtain a cleaner benchmark. Controlled
fault/overload experiments require explicit authorization and safety limits.

## Avoid these unsupported claims

Do not say “stack is always faster,” “branchless is always faster,” “SIMD makes
this W times faster,” “the kernel zeros memory for free,” “a table lookup is
cheaper than arithmetic,” or “this allocator is best.” Name the conditions and
measure them. Never disable security checks, bounds checks, randomization, or
floating-point guarantees simply to improve a benchmark.

## Required output for an optimization task

Use [the report template](templates/performance-report.md). Report the contract,
baseline, diagnosis, changes, proof/testing, environment, per-case measurements,
resource tradeoffs, remaining uncertainty, and keep/revert decision. Mark each
result as measured, derived, hypothesized, or unvalidated. With no execution,
return a patch/proposal and explicit unvalidated items instead of fake numbers.
For design tasks, attach the budget and verification owner; for service changes,
attach the load/recovery evidence and per-budget outcome. Keep workload changes
and performance changes distinguishable.

## Included implementation material

[Examples](examples/README.md) contain original correctness-oriented Rust and
C++ kernels. They are teaching and experiment starting points, not claims of
being faster than a standard library. [Verification](scripts/verify.py) runs the
checks available in the current environment and records skips. Read
[the validation record](validation/README.md) before relying on target coverage.

[Behavioral evaluation scenarios](validation/performance-scenarios.md) test whether
an agent applies the expanded guidance. They are evaluation specifications, not
claims of executed model tests; the package verifier does not run them.

The [2026-09-06 extension validation](validation/books-update-2026-09-06.md)
records executed checks and limits for the systems/prevention addition.
